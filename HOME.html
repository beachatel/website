     Ben Chatel (b. 2004) is a multi disciplinary creative working in Graphic, Sound and Computational design. 

     Born to a French mother and English father, Chatel moved to the U.K in 2005 where they grew up in a small village in Northumberland. Attending Newcastle College in 2021 where they pursued a diploma in Art and Design. They now are an undergraduate studying creative computing at ……
    
    Chatel revels in the use of contemporary technologies in their work. Where others see it as unskilled or a “shortcut”. They feel it opens up so many possibilities to create a plethora of different media. Where they feel traditional methods are unable to communicate the full extent of their ideas.
    
     They have worked in specific digital mediums such as: 
    
    | Graphic Design and Illustration
    | Video editing and VFX
    | Digital animation
    | Sound design 
    | Audio mixing and mastering
    | 3D modeling and rendering
    | Generative Art using Algorithm
    
    Their interest in the use of technology does not diminish their use of traditional physical methods, however it encourages them. Chatel describes their process as highly explorative and experimental. Preferring to create an initial sketch on paper often using ink. They then scan this drawing and digitally manipulate it however they want. After many iterations, creating the final version. This does not just end in a flat refined version of the starting sketch. It could end in any type of format, from video to a 3D Render.
    
    Chatel describes their motivation and interest to create art as a deep ubiquitous need. A one that has long existed. Expressing their love for drawing and sketching as a ritualistic practice that flows automatically, allowing them to clear their mind and think without distraction.
    
    Their personal interests fuel their longing to create, they describe finding deep displeasure when creating work that does not intrigue them in any way and often refrains from doing so. Surrounded by so much visual material Chatel
